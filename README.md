# CS3SD3

This repository contains the Java code that is done in the tutorials of class CS 3SD3 at McMaster University. You are free to use them to help understand the principles and ideas of concurrency.

I am currently working on getting the gitignore to ignore the Eclipse files (sorry about the massive amount currently downloaded!)
